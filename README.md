This project focuses on building a solid foundation for multiclass classification in machine learning. We'll follow these key steps:

-Exploratory Data Analysis: Dive into the data to understand its structure, find relationships, and spot potential problems.
-Feature Engineering: Create and transform the most informative features to help our machine learning models learn better.
-Feature Importance with Shapley Values: Identify which features contribute the most to the model's decisions, allowing us to refine our feature set.
-Model Experimentation: Test different machine learning algorithms to find the one that delivers the best performance for our problem.
-Evaluation: Carefully evaluate the model's success using accurate metrics and determine its ability to correctly classify unseen data.
